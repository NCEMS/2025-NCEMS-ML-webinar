## Welcome!

Thank you for joining us for this hands-on training presented by the National Science Foundation's **N**ational Synthesis **C**enter for **E**mergence in the **M**olecular and Cellular **S**ciences (**NCEMS**)

## Training Components

This training is broken up into four main sections:

**Section 1** - Quantifying the association of a feature with an outcome

**Section 2** - Controlling for confounding factors

**Section 3** - Identifying features that may drive outcomes

**Section 4** - Avoiding data overinterpretation

In each section, the instructor will first walk you through an example application before setting you loose to run Python code that performs analyses to answer real research questions. 

Some applications are accompanied by QR codes - when you see one, scan it with your phone to test your knowledge with a quick quiz question. 

When your instructor says it's time, click the "Datascience | latest" button beneath the NSF | NCEMS logo to launch the environment we will use for the training. Note that you will be prompted to log into CyVerse if you are not already logged in through your internet browser.
